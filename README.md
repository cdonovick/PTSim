In for folder for input generater we have a program that will generate different kinds of input. 
The posibilities are 
[-u] [-I <# instructions>] [-F Frames] [-P <memory pressure - relative to frames>] [-R <freq of references>] [-S <freq of starts/terminaters>]  [-L <Locality of references(1-1000)>]


There is a a line I for how many instructions you want to print. This includes
all types of instructions including START, TERMINATE and REFERENCE. The next two
I have are the ideal frams/memory pressure. It was hard to give memorry pressure
a exact 1-10 or 1-100 range, so I let the user pick. 
Next it the frequence of refernces compared to the frequence of start/end
statements. These are all just a precent. I assume start and stop have the same
value. Locality is how local on a scale of 1-1000.
